# 🛍️ Sales Dashboard for E-Commerce Business (Python)

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analysis and visualization workflow** using Python for an e-commerce sales dataset.  
The goal is to create an **interactive Sales Dashboard** that tracks performance metrics such as revenue, profit, and sales growth, while providing actionable insights into business performance and customer behavior.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze sales data to identify trends and performance KPIs.  
- Calculate metrics such as **Total Sales, Profit Margin, Sales Growth Rate,** and **Average Order Size**.  
- Visualize insights across **time, region, and product categories**.  
- Provide clear business recommendations based on data-driven findings.

## 🧭 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Preparation**  
   - Loaded and merged multiple datasets (Sales, Products, Customers, Regions).  
   - Cleaned data using **Pandas** (handled duplicates, missing values, and outliers).  
   - Standardized column names and formatted dates for time-series analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Used **NumPy** and **Pandas** to compute KPIs: Total Sales, Profit, and Growth Rate.  
   - Performed **trend analysis** to identify top products, profitable regions, and sales patterns.

3. **Visualization & Dashboarding**  
   - Created professional visuals using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
     - Monthly and daily sales trends  
     - Top-selling products and regions  
     - Profit margins by category  
     - Customer purchasing behavior  
   - Designed a simple interactive dashboard in Jupyter Notebook for insights presentation.

4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Top 20% of products contribute ~65% of revenue.  
   - Region C shows consistent profit growth over three months.  
   - Weekday sales peak between 10 AM – 2 PM; recommend time-based promotions.  
   - Suggest optimizing low-margin categories to increase profitability.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Python** | Core programming language |
| **Pandas** | Data cleaning and manipulation |
| **NumPy** | Numerical computation |

## 📊 KPIs & Metrics
- **Total Sales** = Quantity × Price  
- **Profit Margin** = (Profit / Revenue) × 100  
- **Sales Growth Rate** = ((Current – Previous) / Previous) × 100  
- **Average Order Size** = Total Revenue / Total Orders
